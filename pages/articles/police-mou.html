              <p>
                The collaboration between The Nigerian Police Trust Fund and AGED-Network will aid in enhancing the security architecture of the country through provision of state of the art secrity infrastructure to the Nigerian police force.
              </p>

              <p>
                Aged-Network is also embarking on the transformation of the Nigeria Police Force training schools and colleges through the provision of modern equipment. 
              </p>

              <p>
                Plans are currently underway to build 100 housing units for the security agencies in each of Nigeria’s 36 states and FCT. This is in no doubt targeted towards ameliorating the housing challenges being faced by the officers and their families. With this, it has opened new channels of security development through several local and international partnerships.
              </p>

              <p>
                Police is the first respondents in all the civil disorders, related to any violation of law. Police personnel instead of dealing with traditional street crimes, has recently started to deal with sophisticated, organized and diverse form of crimes. 
              </p>
              <p>Enhancing the existing training facilities available to the Nigeria Police Force from what it is today to modern and functional training centers that will meet a world standard is long over-due. In recent times, an increasing interest has developed in this important problem. Outstanding police officials as well as the Government have turned their attention toward the improvement of the police service through the development of systematic and comprehensive police training. </p>
              <p>The Nigeria Police Force is rated as one of the biggest Police forces in the sub-Saharan Africa. This has been demonstrated in the performance of our officers and men of the force engaged in International assignments like the UN peace keeping efforts in the hot trouble sports of Africa and recently played major role in the fight against insurgency, militancy, kidnapping and other vices. </p>
              <p>It is for these reasons that over the years the Nigeria Police has undergone several reforms which are intended to equip it with the required man-power development to meet with the challenges of modern day policing.</p>
              <p>It is an accepted fact that the police cannot successfully carry out their task of maintaining law and order and the detection of crime without adequate training and functional training colleges such as Scotland Yard Police College at Tulliallan. Our first and second generation Police Officers received training in this College as well as in the United States of America</p>
              <p>It should be emphasized here that positive attitude towards the Police by the public are influenced to a great extent by their training, supervision and good leadership. These are key elements towards the attitude of a police to individual citizens. No wonder, in recent times an increasing interest has developed in tackling this all important issue as government have turn their attention towards the improvement of the police through the development of systematic and comprehensive police training.</p>
              <p>The proposed renovation and reconstruction of police training school across the country is a welcome development, and the Inspector General of Police and the Executive Secretary of the Nigeria Police Trust Fund (NPTF) are hereby highly commended for this move. </p>
              <p>Enhancing the existing Central Planning and Training Unit (CPTU) to a modern and training centre that will meet the world standard is long over-due. The present Central Planning and Training Unit (CPTU) suffers infrastructural deficit and it is ill-equipped. As it is now, the Unit has only two blocks which houses the Administrative Block, the Commissioner of Police Office, a conference room and a lecture theater which are all sub-standard and structurally defective.</p>
              <p>The present location of the Central Planning and Training Unit (CPTU) in Jos, Plateau State is neither conducive nor adequate for a modern training centre. There is therefore, the urgent need to relocate the Unit to its permanent site in Minna, Niger State.</p>
              <p>The proposed modern Central Planning and Training Unit (CPTU) when completed and eventually put to use will accommodate personnel from other para-military services like National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), the Federal Road Safety Commission (FRSC), National Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), Nigerian Custom Services (NCS), Nigeria Immigration Services (NIS), Nigeria Prison Services (NPS).</p>
              <p>This centre will also accommodate Police Officers and other Para-military agencies from West African countries and beyond. To effectively combat the menace of the ongoing terrorist activities (Boko Haram) Police personnel now requires some sort of special training to enhance their intelligence, related specifically to counter terrorism, militancy, insurgency, kidnapping, but the intelligence level of The Nigeria Police is no so praiseworthy for tackling terrorism, militancy, kidnapping, cattle rustling, armed robbery, agitations, restiveness, herdsmen issues and controlling insurgence in the North East, North West and other parts of Nigeria where criminality  of all sorts have taken new dimensions.</p>
